					<p>The purpose of the forecheck is to control the ice (mainly the nuetral zone), and rush the opposition, <b>NOT</b> to take the puck from players. Opportunities for takeaways will present themselves as a result of an efficient team forecheck. When you have control of the ice and dictate the opposition's breakout, it forces them to take risks, which will lead to turnovers.</p>

											<h4>First Man In</h4>

											<p>The first man in will try to dictate which side of the ice the puck will come up, allowing his teammates to read the play and take away options.</p>

											<p><b>DO NOT</b> chase the player behind the net, unless you can keep inside position on him.</p>

											<p>The first animation shows how chasing behind the net leads to 3 passing options for D #1. The second animation shows green properly waiting for D #1 to choose a side, then angling D #1 up that side of the ice, allowing his teammates the key on that. As a result, D #1 now only has one direct option.</p>

											<p>Notice something as simple as chasing behind the net and losing position gives the opposition every option they could hope for up the ice, leading to easy entry.</p>

											<p>Also notice the inside out angle green takes to eliminate a pass back across the ice. This angle takes away the D to D pass and makes the long pass up to FWD #4 difficult and risky, all while forcing the play up the left.</p>

											<h4>Keys for the First Man In</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>Keep inside position on the puck carrier</li>
												<li>Eliminate the puck carrier's option to pass up the middle or back across the ice</li>
												<li>Once you have dictated which side of the ice you are forcing the puck carrier, <b>DO NOT</b> allow him to chage sides</li>

											<h4>Notes</h4>

											<p>In this scenario the puck is pushed up the right side to blue. D #1 is being aggressive and steps up to challenge blue outside the blue line. Note how blue comes back to the puck slightly to give himself some room to operate.</p>

											<p>Blue is looking to see what D #2 does. Here D #2 takes away blue's direct passing option to red. This is an extremely aggressive approach by the defense. Since red is taken away, blue rims the puck around the boards hard where there is no defender to beat green to the puck.</p>

											<p>Red is anticipating recieving a pass, or if there is no pass, red should keep skating expecting a short chip to the right wing's side boards. Neither of those options are used in this scenario.</p>

											<p>Green must also payattention to what D #2 is doing so he can anticipate the rim around. Green must keep his speed up trusting that blue will know to rim the puck around.</p>

											<p>Once green retrieves the puck, he will be under significant pressure. To relieve pressure green can rim the puck quickly back to blue along the boards. If D #4 trys to pressure green, green can make the easy pass to yellow.</p>

											<h4>Notes</h4>

											<p>This scenario is the same, defensively, as the first. This time blue, again, see's that D #2 is stepping up to red, so blue chips (saucers) the puck to the short side boards.</p>

											<p>Red has full momentum into the zone. D #2 has momentum towards red. When red doesn't receive the puck, red should be able to blow by D #2 to reteive the puck on the short side boards.</p>

											<p>Once red retrieves the puck, he will be under significant pressure. To relieve pressure red can rim the puck quickly over to green along the boards.</p>

							<h4>Important Concepts</h4>

							<p>We are out numbering the defense high in the zone. Red, Teal and Blue have 2 defenders defending them. This is our point of puck control. In theory we should be able to hold the puck between the 3 of them for the entire powerplay if we chose not to shoot. We must know our options to relieve pressure for aggressive penalty killers. Do not panick, find the open man to relieve pressure.</p>

							<h4>Concept</h4>

							<p>This first example starts in your own d-zone with a significant amount of time for the defensemen to work with. The puck carrying defenseman starts by moving up the ice at an angle drawing the defense to one side of the ice. The supporting defenseman slides underneath the puck carrier creating and angle for a "reverse pass". Once the "reverse pass" is completed, with the defense drawn to one side of the ice, this should give the supporting defensemen time, speed, and momentum to make a play up the ice.</p>

													<p>The key is for both defensemen to support eachother. As one d-man starts up the ice, looking for options, the other d-man should always create an option to reverse the puck and start the breakout in the opposite direction.</p>
