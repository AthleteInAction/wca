		<h4>Concept</h4>

		<p>This first example starts in your own d-zone with a significant amount of time for the defensemen to work with. The puck carrying defenseman starts by moving up the ice at an angle drawing the defense to one side of the ice. The supporting defenseman slides underneath the puck carrier creating and angle for a "reverse pass". Once the "reverse pass" is completed, with the defense drawn to one side of the ice, this should give the supporting defensemen time, speed, and momentum to make a play up the ice.</p>

								<p>The key is for both defensemen to support eachother. As one d-man starts up the ice, looking for options, the other d-man should always create an option to reverse the puck and start the breakout in the opposite direction.</p>

								<p>In the above example, yellow starts up the ice, at an angle, drawing the defense to one side of the ice. He then reverses the puck to teal, which gives the entire breakout time to build momentum up the ice.</p>

		<h4>Concept</h4>

		<p>This example starts in your own d-zone with a significant amount of time for the defensemen to work with. The defensemen are looking to pass wide D to D. When the D makes the pass, the wing on the side of the passing d-man, sweeps up the middle of the ice assuming the center's position. The player last playing the center position assumes the wing's position. This can continue forever until something opens up.</p>
