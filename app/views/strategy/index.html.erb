					<p>The purpose of the forecheck is to control the ice (mainly the nuetral zone), and rush the opposition, <b>NOT</b> to take the puck from players. Opportunities for takeaways will present themselves as a result of an efficient team forecheck.

											<p>In a perfect world the goal would be to force the opposition to carry the puck up the green arrows, protecting the red area.</p>

											<p>If we can force the puck carrier to try and enter the zone from positions "A" and "B" on the graphic, our D men should have no trouble standing the blue line and forcing a dump in.</p>

											<p>If we allow the opposition to bring the puck up through the middle (red area), our D men cannot stand the blue line and are forced to allow the puck carrier to cross.</p>

												<% end %>
											</div>

											<br>

											<p>Lets start by getting to the end result first, then work our way back.</p>

											<p>In this example we've successfully forced the puck carrier up the left side. The strong side FWD (Blue) has the responsibility of not letting the puck carrier cut back to the middle. Blue "traps" the puck carrier into Yellow. The puck carrier has no option but to dump the puck in.</p>

											<p>Note that it is important that blue does not get over aggressive and allow the puck carrier the make a move around yellow, this will create an odd man situation. Yellow is trusting that he has support from blue. Yellow must recognize when he has no support from blue and know, that in such case, yellow cannot be aggressive at the blue line. If yellow is aggressive at the blue line, and FWD #5 makes a move around yellow, without support from blue, it will end in a 2 on 1 situation.</p>

											<p>If the puck carrier is able to make it around yellow, blue should continue back into the zone taking yellow's position, while yellow takes blue's position, until both have an opportunity to switch back.</p>

											<p><b>If you are a D-Man and you are going for a hit at the blue line, be sure you have an angle to complete a successful hit. Do not be over aggressive and give up position going for reckless hits, unless we are up by 5 goals, then anything goes!</p>

											<p>The first man in will try to dictate which side of the ice the puck will come up, allowing his teammates to read the play and take away options.</p>

											<p><b>DO NOT</b> chase the player behind the net, unless you can keep inside position on him.</p>

											<p>The first animation shows how chasing behind the net leads to 3 passing options for D #1. The second animation shows green properly waiting for D #1 to choose a side, then angling D #1 up that side of the ice, allowing his teammates the key on that. As a result, D #1 now only has one direct option.</p>

											<p>Notice something as simple as chasing behind the net and losing position gives the opposition every option they could hope for up the ice, leading to easy entry.</p>

											<p>Also notice the inside out angle green takes to eliminate a pass back across the ice. This angle takes away the D to D pass and makes the long pass up to FWD #4 difficult and risky, all while forcing the play up the left.</p>

											<h4>Keys for the First Man In</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>Keep inside position on the puck carrier</li>
												<li>Eliminate the puck carrier's option to pass up the middle or back across the ice</li>
												<li>Once you have dictated which side of the ice you are forcing the puck carrier, <b>DO NOT</b> allow him to chage sides</li>

											<br>

											<p>Once the opposition knows you are not going to chase them behind the net, we can pin them in their own zone.</p>

											<p>Notice how when green keeps D #1 pinned behind the net, D #1 can only pass up the sides (which feeds into our objective). D #1 can only pass to the green shaded area, the red shaded area (middle) is eliminated allowing green's teammates to key on their man.</p>

											<p>Red can now key on D #2, Blue can key on FWD #3, yellow on FWD #5, and teal on FWD #4.</p>

											<h3>Common Mistakes</h3>

											<div align="center">
												<%= link_to asset_path('forecheck-1-2-2-donts-A.gif'),target: '_blank' do %>
												<%= image_tag 'forecheck-1-2-2-donts-A.gif',class: 'img-responsive' %>
												<% end %>
											</div>

											<br>

											<p>It is critical that everyone sticks to their responsibility. In this example green properly angles D #1 up the left side of the ice. Blue makes the mistake of chasing the puck and try's to double team D #1. This opens up the neutral zone and provides many options for the opposition.</p>

											<h4>Blue's Mistakes</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>Blue does not support yellow coming back up the ice. This does 2 things for yellow:
													<ol>
														<li>Yellow cannot pressure FWD #5 early allowing FWD #5 to gain the center line. Once FWD #5 gains the center line, FWD #5 can dump the puck to an un-guarded FWD #4, if under pressure. There is little chance of creating a turnover in the neutral zone if FWD #5 is allowed to gain the center line.</li>
														<li>Yellow is forced to back into the zone with the puck carrier allowing easy entry.</li>
													</ol>
												</li>
												<li>Blue also gives up a passing lane from FWD #5 to FWD #3. Once the puck is allowed to come up through the middle, the D have no choice but to back into the zone.</li>
											</ul>

											<h4>Result</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>By 2 forecheckers chasing the puck carrier, we now only have 2 D men and a third backchecker (Red, who is behind the play), protecting the neutral zone and blue line. This has created 4 on 3 situation in the neutral zone, leading to a 3 on 2 rush for the opposition.</li>
											</ul>

											<h4>Fix</h4>

											<div align="center">
												<%= link_to asset_path('forecheck-1-2-2-donts-A-fix.gif'),target: '_blank' do %>
												<%= image_tag 'forecheck-1-2-2-donts-A-fix.gif',class: 'img-responsive' %>
												<% end %>
											</div>

											<br>

											<p>This time blue properly maintains his support role up the side boards. With blue's support, yellow can now pressure FWD #5 early making it difficult to gain the center line.</p>

											<p>Blue's positioning also takes away the pass option to the middle (FWD #3). FWD #5 is now in a difficult position where he cannot dump the puck in. His options are to force a pass to the middle, a soft chip up the puck side boards into the zone, or a long cross ice pass attempt to FWD #4. All have major risks of a turnover.</p>

											<p>Note red's positioning before D #1 makes the pass to FWD #5. Red is defending the passing lane from D #1 to FWD #4, then once the pass is made to FWD #5, red shifts to support the middle of the ice.</p>

											</div>

											<h4>Notes</h4>

											<p>In this scenario the puck is pushed up the right side to blue. D #1 is being aggressive and steps up to challenge blue outside the blue line. Note how blue comes back to the puck slightly to give himself some room to operate.</p>

											<p>Blue is looking to see what D #2 does. Here D #2 takes away blue's direct passing option to red. This is an extremely aggressive approach by the defense. Since red is taken away, blue rims the puck around the boards hard where there is no defender to beat green to the puck.</p>

											<p>Red is anticipating recieving a pass, or if there is no pass, red should keep skating expecting a short chip to the right wing's side boards. Neither of those options are used in this scenario.</p>

											<p>Green must also payattention to what D #2 is doing so he can anticipate the rim around. Green must keep his speed up trusting that blue will know to rim the puck around.</p>

											<p>Once green retrieves the puck, he will be under significant pressure. To relieve pressure green can rim the puck quickly back to blue along the boards. If D #4 trys to pressure green, green can make the easy pass to yellow.</p>

											<h4>Notes</h4>

											<p>This scenario is the same, defensively, as the first. This time blue, again, see's that D #2 is stepping up to red, so blue chips (saucers) the puck to the short side boards.</p>

											<p>Red has full momentum into the zone. D #2 has momentum towards red. When red doesn't receive the puck, red should be able to blow by D #2 to reteive the puck on the short side boards.</p>

											<p>Once red retrieves the puck, he will be under significant pressure. To relieve pressure red can rim the puck quickly over to green along the boards.</p>

							<h4>Important Concepts</h4>

							<p>We are out numbering the defense high in the zone. Red, Teal and Blue have 2 defenders defending them. This is our point of puck control. In theory we should be able to hold the puck between the 3 of them for the entire powerplay if we chose not to shoot. We must know our options to relieve pressure for aggressive penalty killers. Do not panick, find the open man to relieve pressure.</p>

							<p>Yellow should postion himself medium to high in the slot. Do not get too close to the goalie where you are not a passing option. This will also give you a better angle for a potential one timer.</p>

							<p>In this example the opposition is being aggressive and pressuring the puck hard on the powerplay. It is important that everyone knows what's going to happen in this situation.</p>

							<p>FWD #2 pressure's Red, FWD #1 takes away Teal, D #4 takes away Green, and D# 3 takes away Yellow. Blue is the open man, but with Red being pressured, the passing lanes have been cut off and the pass from Red to Blue becomes a high risk play.</p>

							<p>To releive pressure, Red rims the puck around the boards to Blue. Blue should be anticipating this play when the penalty killers are being that aggressive.</p>

							<p>When the puck gets to Blue, we are now set up in our umbrella powerplay on the other side of the ice. Also note that the defense is now all caught on one side of the ice, forcing them to scramble to get back into position.</p>

							<h4>Notes</h4>

							<p>Notice how when Red is being pressured, and D #4 decides to take away Green. Green then moves towards the slot area slightly. This keeps D #4 out of the passing lane for Red to rim around to Blue. <b>Green should not move below the goaline if D #4 decides to take away Green.</b></p>

							<p>Also note how Yellow stars close to the net as the puck is high in the zone. As the puck moves lower in the zone, Yellow moves higher in the slot, away from the net, to create an angle for a one-T from Red or Green. When the puck is high, Yellow trys to screen the goalie. When the puck is low, Yellow moves to create an angle for a one-T near the slot.</p>

							<h4>Concept</h4>

							<p>This first example starts in your own d-zone with a significant amount of time for the defensemen to work with. The puck carrying defenseman starts by moving up the ice at an angle drawing the defense to one side of the ice. The supporting defenseman slides underneath the puck carrier creating and angle for a "reverse pass". Once the "reverse pass" is completed, with the defense drawn to one side of the ice, this should give the supporting defensemen time, speed, and momentum to make a play up the ice.</p>

							<h4>Concept</h4>

							<p>This example starts in your own d-zone with a significant amount of time for the defensemen to work with. The defensemen are looking to pass wide D to D. When the D makes the pass, the wing on the side of the passing d-man, sweeps up the middle of the ice assuming the center's position. The player last playing the center position assumes the wing's position. This can continue forever until something opens up.</p>

													<p>Both defensemen need to stay wide and present an option for a D to D pass. When the opportuniy presents itself, make the pass to a forward. The key is patience. This is designed for teams clogging the neutral zone.</p>

													<div class="row">

														<div class="col-md-6">
															<h4>Options:</h4>
															<ul>
																<li>Pass to a forward who has time to make a play. (Do not pass your forwards into a big hit which can cause a bad turnover)</li>
																<li>Skate the puck into the zone, inheriting the risk that if you turn it over it will most likely end up in an odd man opportunity, or breakaway the other way.</li>
																<li>Dump the puck into the zone</li>
																<li>Reverse the puck to your D partner to start the breakout in the opposite direction</li>
															</ul>
														</div>

														<div class="col-md-6">
															<h4>Expectations:</h4>
															<ul>
																<li>Put your forwards in positions to make plays, not turnovers.</li>
																<li>If you are going to dump the puck in, do it high at the redline. This will allow the forwards to keep their speed into the zone. If you skate passed the redline, it will be presumed that you are skating into the zone, or rimming the puck around the boards.
