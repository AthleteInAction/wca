		<p>All positions are pretty much interchangeable on the powerplay. Think of each color as spots, everyone should be able to play any spot.</p>

		<h4>Important Concepts</h4>

		<p>We are out numbering the defense high in the zone. Red, Teal and Blue have 2 defenders defending them. This is our point of puck control. In theory we should be able to hold the puck between the 3 of them for the entire powerplay if we chose not to shoot. We must know our options to relieve pressure for aggressive penalty killers. Do not panick, find the open man to relieve pressure.</p>

		<h4>Concept</h4>

		<p>This first example starts in your own d-zone with a significant amount of time for the defensemen to work with. The puck carrying defenseman starts by moving up the ice at an angle drawing the defense to one side of the ice. The supporting defenseman slides underneath the puck carrier creating and angle for a "reverse pass". Once the "reverse pass" is completed, with the defense drawn to one side of the ice, this should give the supporting defensemen time, speed, and momentum to make a play up the ice.</p>

								<p>The key is for both defensemen to support eachother. As one d-man starts up the ice, looking for options, the other d-man should always create an option to reverse the puck and start the breakout in the opposite direction.</p>

								<p>In the above example, yellow starts up the ice, at an angle, drawing the defense to one side of the ice. He then reverses the puck to teal, which gives the entire breakout time to build momentum up the ice.</p>

		<p>This example starts in your own d-zone with a significant amount of time for the defensemen to work with. The defensemen are looking to pass wide D to D.
